_[ A brief synopsis of this library ]._

## Installation

### Xcode Projects

Select `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency` and enter `https://github.com/bitrise-io/AciSpmSample`.

### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add `AciSpmSample` as a package dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/bitrise-io/AciSpmSample",
            exact: "0.0.1"
        ),
    ],
    //...
)
```

<!-- üîë UNCOMMENT THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF THE GITHUB REPO NAME MATCHES THE PACKAGE NAME üëá -->

<!--

From there, refer to `AciSpmSample` as a "target dependency" in any of _your_ package's targets that need it.

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
          "AciSpmSample",
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

-->

<!-- üîë UNCOMMENT THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF THE GITHUB REPO NAME DOESN'T MATCH THE PACKAGE NAME üëá -->

From there, refer to the `AciSpmSample` "product" delivered by the `AciSpmSample` "package" inside of any of your project's target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
            .product(
                name: "AciSpmSample",
                package: "AciSpmSample"
            ),
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

<!-- Proceed from above choice accordingly (and delete this comment) -->

Then simply `import AciSpmSample` wherever you‚Äôd like to use it.

<!--
    üîë UNCOMMENT THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF USING THE `@_exported` feature
    might be handy. üëá
-->

<!-- **üìù Note:** To make the library available to your entire project, you could also leverage the [functionality of the `@_exported` keyword](https://forums.swift.org/t/package-manager-exported-dependencies/11615) by placing the following line somewhere at the top level of your project:

```swift
@_exported import AciSpmSample
``` -->
